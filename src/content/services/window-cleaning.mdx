## What does a window cleaning service include?

You can hire our window cleaner near you to take care of your windows and other glass surfaces to remove dirt and streaks and protect against future marks. The steps and inclusions will depend on the type of services you request, like:

### Residential window cleaning

Residential window cleaning includes cleaning both the inside and outside of your windows (and sliding doors), including upstairs and downstairs if you’re on multiple levels. Usually, a professional window cleaner will begin with removing any sliding glass from the tracks before brushing or wiping down flyscreens, cleaning window frames and tracks, then wiping down sills and jambs. Finally, your cleaner will wipe, spray, and squeegee your glass windows and then return them to their tracks. 

### Balcony glass cleaning

Glass balcony panelling helps you open up your space and make the most of the surrounding view, but it can take some extra maintenance. A window cleaner near you can help with regular balcony cleans to keep your home in top condition. Your cleaner will check fittings for any corrosion or damage and use long poles and tools to help reach over the side of your balcony and make sure both sides are free from dirt, fingerprints, bird poo, and smudges.

### Pool fence cleaning

Pool fences need to be cleaned regularly to remove salt and chlorine build-up, prevent corrosion, and keep them looking great. Because some glass pool fences have special coatings to repel water, your window cleaning specialist will use detergents to remove buildup on the glass, and then polish to remove streaks and marks. They’ll also clean the poles, joins, and balustrades with non-abrasive cleaners to remove buildup, spider webs and dirt, and check that they are secure.

### Mirror cleaning

Mirrors attract dirt, fingerprints and smudges. A professional mirror cleaner will clean the mirrors in your bathrooms, entryways, and bedrooms. Mirror cleaning usually involves cleaning around the outside of the mirror with a damp cloth or duster to remove dirt and spider webs. Then your cleaner will use detergents and non-abrasive cloths to clean the surface, followed by a polish and dry to leave it free of marks and streaks.
