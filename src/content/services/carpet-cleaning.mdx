## What does a carpet cleaning service include?

The most common professional carpet cleaning services involve either carpet steam cleaning, dry cleaning, or shampooing the carpets in your home (depending on their preferred techniques and equipment). But most carpet cleaners can do a lot more than just your carpets. The inclusions of cleaning services will vary, depending on what you need:

### General carpet cleaning

Most modern homes will have at least three carpeted bedrooms that need a deep clean once a year. Before your professional cleaner arrives, try to expose as much carpet fibres as possible by moving small furniture pieces to other areas of your home (don’t worry about larger furniture, as the carpet underneath won’t be super dirty). Vacuum the floor to remove surface dirt unless your cleaner includes this in their cleaning services. Your cleaner will take a couple of hours to clean your floors, paying particular attention to any stains. Before you put back your furniture or any floor coverings, it’s ideal if you can wait a few hours to let the carpet dry. You can speed up the process by turning your fans on high and encouraging airflow.

### Carpet stain removal

Stains happen, but you don’t have to live with them forever. Simply find a carpet steam cleaning service near you that’s experienced in carpet stain removal from coffee and wine to crayons, pen marks, and pet messes. We’ll focus their efforts on removing stubborn stains with powerful equipment and cleaning solutions to loosen up the marks and get your carpet looking (and smelling) fresh again.

### Rug cleaning

Don’t forget to include your rugs when you book your carpet cleaning service. Professional rug cleaning will help get your rug looking like new so it can last for years to come. As with carpet cleaning, you can expect your cleaner to use their equipment and chemicals to deep-clean the carpet fibres and remove any stains. Then you’ll need to allow a few hours for your rugs to dry.

### Couch and upholstery cleaning

Get your fabric lounge chairs smelling like new again with professional couch cleaning and upholstery cleaning. Your cleaner will use special chemicals and equipment to dissolve stains and built-up grime, before rinsing it clean. It might take up to 24 hours for your lounge chairs to thoroughly dry.

### Mattress cleaning

Find a carpet cleaning service near you that offers mattress cleaning, and you can get all the soft furnishings in your home sorted. Refresh your mattress with a deep clean to reduce allergens like dust mites and germs. Your cleaner will inspect, vacuum, and pre-treat your mattress. Then we’ll extract the dirt, rinse your mattress, and deodorise it to help it stay fresh for longer.
